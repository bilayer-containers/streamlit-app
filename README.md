# streamlit-app

A Streamlit app built with [linkml's](https://linkml.io/) Pydantic generator and [streamlit-pydantic](https://github.com/lukasmasuch/streamlit-pydantic) (specifically, [this fork](https://github.com/Institutional-Investment-Group/streamlit-pydantic/tree/feature/handle-optional-type)), which automatically converts the Bilayers specification into a Streamlit application.
